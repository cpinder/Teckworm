      <p>Hello, my name is Chris.  I've been working as an I.T. Service Desk team member for over 6 years and went to school for I.T.  before that.  A big part of earning my degree, getting hired, and getting promoted has been earning certifications.  Often, what gets you a chance to interview or be considered for a promotion comes down to showing you are qualified -- a certification can do that for you. 
      <b>Of course you know this!  hat is why you’re here in the first place, so let’s get to it!
      <p>What you need to know right off the bat:
      <ol>
      <li>This site is really basic, on purpose. I am not great with HTML and you’re not here to see some cool web design anyway.  There are many sites you can explore for that kind of information.</li>
      <li>My goal is for you to really know this information and be able to use it professionally.  Passing the certification should be the easy part. </li>
      <li>To earn a certification, you have to put in a decent amount of work.  You can’t watch a 2-hour video or click through an exam dump and pass one of these tests.  You need to research, takes notes, make flash cards, and really dig into the material or you won’t pass.  I’ll show you how to prepare effectively, work full time and pass the certification the first time.  </li>
